# ðŸ§® Basic Calculator (Python CLI)

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python â€” my first hands-on project.

It runs in a Linux terminal and supports basic arithmetic operations. This project reflects my foundational understanding of Python, command-line interfaces, and version control using Git and GitHub.

### ðŸ”§ What I Learned:
- Writing clean, functional Python code
- Handling user input via the CLI
- Using Git and GitHub to track changes and publish code
- How to research and troubleshoot common coding errors

### ðŸš€ Tech Stack:
- Python
- Linux CLI
- Git & GitHub

This project helped me build confidence and momentum as I continue my journey toward DevOps and automation. More projects coming soon!
